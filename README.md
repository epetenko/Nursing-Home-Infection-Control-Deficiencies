# Nursing-Home-Infection-Control-Deficiencies
CMS Nursing Home Compare data filtered to nursing homes with infection control-related deficiencies.

### What this is

CMS publishes datasets for Nursing Home Compare on a number of factors, including [Nursing Home Deficiencies](https://data.medicare.gov/Nursing-Home-Compare/Deficiencies-Displayed-on-Nursing-Home-Compare-Cyc/np3k-uatv)

For ease of reporters looking at infection control preparedness for the coronavirus, I downloaded the data for the last three cycles (36 months) and quickly filtered it to deficiency tag 880, violations related to infection control. The code I used is included, the original data is not; it's huge.

Just note that a previous violation may not be an indication of a severe problem; check out a pattern of violations as well as the Severity (labeled B-L) to get an idea of the scope of the problem.

You can use the [Nursing Home Compare tool](https://www.medicare.gov/nursinghomecompare/search.html?) or the [Propublica Nursing Home Inspect tool](https://projects.propublica.org/nursing-homes/) to find the actual inspection report.
